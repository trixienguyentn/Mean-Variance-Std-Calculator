# Data Analysis with Python Projects for Certifications:

1.Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

2.Demographic Data Analyzer
Analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database 
- Input dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data

3.Medical Data Visualizer
Visualize and make calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas. The dataset values were collected during medical examinations.

- Input dataset: medical_examination.csv
- Output: catplot.png, heatmap.png

4.Page View Time Series Visualizer
Visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03

- Input dataset: fcc-forum-pageviews.csv
- Output: line_plot.png, bar_plot.png, box_plot.png

5.Sea Level Predictor
Analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. You will use the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
- Input: epa-sea-level.csv
- Output:
